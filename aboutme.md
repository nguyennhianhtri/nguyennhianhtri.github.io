## Some words from the owner of this blog
Hey there! Thanks for stepping into my world.

A Solution Engineer at Salesforce by trade, I hail from Vietnam and have been calling Singapore my 2nd home since 2008.

I like technology. I like learning about how computers communicate and how that then enables us to communicate better. 

I am working towards starting my tech company. So I'm always on the lookout for my future partner(s) and great ideas.
