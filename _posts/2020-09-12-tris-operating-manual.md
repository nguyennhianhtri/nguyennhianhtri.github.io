**How would you describe your personality or working style?**

* To a large extent, I prioritize efficiency. That means that my working style generally revolves around achieving the maximum possible impact with the minimum amount of effort/time investment. It also means that I prefer not to call meetings unless I feel it is necessary and beneficial to all parties involved.
* I am a big believer in substance over style. While having flair can help carry your content across, I believe what is important and what ultimately gets things done is having the substance to back that up. Therefore, I prefer people getting to the point. I absolutely respect people who show their capabilities through actions rather than words. 
* I like to work independently, but will place efficiency above all else. So I can collaborate effectively if there is a need to. 
* I do not trust easily and therefore can appear closed off upon first meeting. However, once I trust someone, I place complete faith in them and become much more open to that person.
* I work in bursts of high productivity, and that also means I need adequate rest time in between. I can’t really do the “sit for 4-5 hours straight” working style, but I absolutely respect those who can maintain their concentration for such extended periods. This also applies to meetings, I can focus very well for shorter duration but I don’t do as well for long meetings (>1.5h)
* I demand the best out of myself and I have a tendency to carry the same expectations to those I work with.
* I enjoy healthy competition. Knowing that there is always someone out there who is so much better than me at something just gives me the motivation to continually improve myself.

**Why do you do what you do?  What is your life and leadership purpose?**

* Most of the things I do are out of pure passion. I always put in that extra 1% for things I am passionate about. Conversely, I procrastinate endlessly if I am forced to do something I don’t give two hoots about.
* Outside of passion, recognition for my expertise and guidance to others also motivates me. I want to be the de-facto expert in the room whom everyone can turn to when they are in need.
* My leadership principle can be summarized in two words: transparency and empowerment. I place clear expectations on those around me and under me, and will always provide justifications for all rewards or punishments. Likewise, I appreciate candid feedback from others and prefer to foster an open culture in my teams. I endeavor to empower all those whom I work with, for or under me to be the best version of themselves. How I see it, a team is only as strong as it’s weakest link. Only by empowering all members of the team can the collective reach the best version of itself.

**What is most important to you, inside and outside work?  Describe your values.**

* Individuality - I value mine and everyone else’s uniqueness. After all, the world would be a lot more boring if we are all the same kind of people.
* Honesty - The Truth is never bad for you in the long run.
* Loyalty - I value people who stand by their principles and their closed ones regardless of the situation.
* Integrity - I will not give anyone my word nonchalantly. If I make a promise, I will fulfill it regardless of how hard it is.
* Fun - Life is plenty stressful. So it’s extremely important for me to have fun in whatever I do.

**What excites you about life?  When do you experience flow?**

* Improbable odds - I am a David at heart and am always on the look out for my Goliath because that’s how I can grow the fastest.
* The future - I am a dreamer. You never know what life is going to throw at you, and that’s part of the fun.
* Gaming - A gamer to the core, I love competitive gaming and seeing my skills improve day-to-day. I used to play a lot of DotA/DotA2, and competed briefly. Nowadays
* Music and movies - I am an avid movie and music fan. While I do tend to prefer oldies, I will give anything a chance. I also have an elaborate rating system for my music and movies collection.
* I am easily bothered by environmental factors so I can only experience flow in a quiet environment, without the usual 21st century distractions.

**How do you celebrate life?  Rituals or traditions? what do you do to rest and play and honour yourself?**

* I celebrate life with the people closest to me. Spending quality time together doing things that we both enjoy and just in general having honest, no-bullshit exchanges makes me feel the most fulfilled.
* I like to wake up early, although you won’t find me coming early to work unless necessary. I enjoy my alone time in the morning and have an elaborate ritual that involves meditating, reading and (occasionally) exercising.
* I get swept up by life sometimes, and rest by deliberately slowing down and getting more in touch with my inner self. This could be done through a book or just immersing myself in my playlist.

**What is most misunderstood about you, if anything, that you would like to clarify?**

* I seem like a very quiet person when you first meet me, but it’s just my dislikes of small talks. Talk to me about something you are passionate about and my face will light up.
* I have been told that my face looks really scary when I don’t smile. That does not mean that I am actually a scary person, or that I am upset with you. As mentioned previously, if I am upset with you, I will tell you.

**What else should people know about your work?**

* I take a lot of pride in my work, and tend to spend a lot of efforts making sure it is properly reflected.
* I am conscious of deadlines and will always deliver my work in time.
* I like to inject a bit of my personality into my work, so I will sometimes put some Easter Eggs inside things.

**When things start to get stressful, I look like this**

* I usually don’t get stressed easily. When I do, most people would not notice that I am actually stressed. But if you are close to me, I will confide in you and that’s how you would know that I am actually stressed.
* When I am stressed, I will also tend to distance myself from the things that are stressing me out and will become more closed off to my surroundings.

**How can people build trust with you?**

* Continue to deliver, communicate openly and always own up to your mistakes.

**How do people lose points with you / break trust?  What drives you nuts?**

* People who overpromise and underdeliver.
* People who do not own up to their mistakes.
* People whose only purpose in life is material. I get it, money is important, but if money is the only thing that matters to you, you will not get my respect.

**What qualities do you particularly value in people who work with you?  Why?**

* Loyal - I need to trust people to work well with them.
* Honest - I tend to go off analyzing people’s every reactions, so it would make things much easier for you and me if you are just honest with me.
* Humble - I tend to judge people by their works, not their words.
* Organized - The world is messy, so I appreciate people who could help to whittle down the mess. Also I am a bit of a “yolo” person, so I appreciate a balancing counterpart to keep me in check.

**What is the best way to communicate with you?**

* I appreciate people who communicate openly and honestly with me. This does not mean that I usually appreciate people being “brutally honest”. The truth, no matter how unpleasant, can always be communicated tactfully.
* Do give me some short notice (0.5-1h) before you break bad news to me. But try not to give me long notice because I would spend the whole time agonizing about what the news is.
* I really dislike the “if you cannot convince them, confuse them” tactic. I am good at detecting bullshit, and will tune out once I start hearing bullshit.
